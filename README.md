# TestCode
Simple (ish) firmware to test various MCUs

(Just the ESP ones for the moment.  More to come...)

I do all of my coding in Atom & use PlatformIO for MCUs.
Let me know if you have trouble getting these to work in (UGH!) Arduino.

This repository also tends to get treated as a crash test dummy for GitHub handling...
